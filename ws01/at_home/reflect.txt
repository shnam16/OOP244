1. What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
-A namespace is a scope for the entities that it encloses. The purpose is avoiding the identifier conflicts across different namespaces.

2. Why are header files needed? Explain.
- Header files are needed to seperate the interface from the implementation. The header files will reduce compilation times and also the amount of recompilation needed when something in the implementation changes.

3. In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but not the .h files. Explain why you should never compile header files.

- The reason of why I should never compile the header file is that I don't need because in the .cpp files, the files already include the .h file which is a header file. And in a .h file, it contains only declaration for interfaces between the source files of a program.

4. Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.

- The reason is that .cpp files contain the implementation of the program and function. There is no need to include it in another file.

5. Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.

- In this workshop, I have learned somethings. First of all, I have never learned about the object oriented program, so it's first time to study.
Secondly, I learned how to show the output like cout<< and how to input the value in C++ like cin>>. And also I have learned what is the namespace and why I need a namespace in the module.
Finally. I have learned what implementation file and header file is.
