1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.
- No, it didn't compile when I tried to put the templated functions in Data.cpp. In ws9_lab.cpp file, it cannot find the identifier.
2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?
- If I moved the template function after the main(), it works.
3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double argouments? What is the advantage of using templates?
- Yes, I could have done this lab without templates, however, as I used the templates, it reduce the repetition of code and it makes static polymorphism.
4. Are the following equivalent?
template<class T>
template<typename T>
- Yes, they are same because they are for identifying a type.
