1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
- An abstract class is meant to be used as the base class from which other classes are derived. It defines an interface, but does not necessarily provide implementations for all its member functions. A derived class that implements all the missing functionality is called a concrete class. A concrete class is expected to provide implementations for the member functions that are not implemented in the base class.

- credit() and debit() function.
3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
- I have learned what the pure virtual function is and abstract class and a concrete class.
