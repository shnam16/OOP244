1. Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
- If I don't check the self-assignment, delete statement could remove the resources and it will lead to loss of access to the source data.
2. List examples of how you avoided code duplication.
- I made a isValid function to validate phone numbers.
3. List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
- I have learned how to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory and how to work with resources.
