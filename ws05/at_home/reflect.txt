1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
- Because the result is calculated from the local variable inside the function. So, returning by refernce will be issued to go out of scope.
2. List the temporary object in the w5_at_home.cpp main module.
- (a+b), (b+d), (b+=d), (a==c), (a!=c)
3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize code duplication.
- I use rhs, a, b, c, d etc. arguments to minimize my code.
4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
- I have learned how to overload operators and how to use them. 

Quiz 4 Reflection
4.a) Write down the function prototype that overloads the binary operator + as a member operator. The operator takes an amount of quantity as a parameter. It returns a reference to an Item project.
Wrong answer: Item& operator+(const Item&);
Correct answer: Item& operator+(int a);
