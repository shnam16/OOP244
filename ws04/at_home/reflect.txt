1. What is a safe empty state? Could you define a safe empty state that differs from the empty state that you defined?
- Safe empty state is the initialized states for the object's instance variables in a consturctor to ensure that the object has a well-defined state from the running time.
Yes, I can define other state to be a safe empty state as long as they are inititalized in a consistent manner.
2. Identify the parts of your source code where to minimized code duplication.
- When I called the function which has the particular ability to do the task instead of making a new code.
3. The canTravelWith(...) member function accesses the private data of the object referenced in its parameter. Explain why C++ allows this access.
- The function is the member function of the object that referenced parameter belongs to.
4. What statement did you add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly?
- I added passengerName[size - 1 -for me 18] = '\0'; after the strncpy function. The reason to do this is to ensure the null terminator is added at the end of an array.
5. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
- I have learned how to use strncpy, fill and width to display well. And I have learned how to make a class and declare private data and public. I have learned a consturctor.

Quiz 3 Reflection
1. What is the purpose of using member functions?
Wrong answer: It enables the external access to the class.
Correct answer: It enables the external access to the object.
3. What is the purpose of declaring data members as private?
Wrong answer: It identifies all members listed in the class definition as inaccessible.
Correct answer: If the data members of a class are private, client code cannot initialize their values directly.
4. What is the purpose of declaring member functions as public?
Wrong answer: It identifies all members listed in the class definition as accessible.
Correct answer: The member functions of a class provide the communication links between client code and objects of the class.  
5. Wrong answer: 3.2.$$$C++,707
                       3.1.$$$xyz,10
Correct answer: 3.2.3.1.$$$C++,707
                    $$$xyz,10
