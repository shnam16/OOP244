1. How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the acoount? Why?
-4. Because the max year is stored by 4. It can only accept the account of four years.
2. Your class declares two member functions named set(...). In C, this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
- This feature is overloading. We can make many functions which have same name, but in the function's parameters have to be different.
3. What have you learned in completing this workshop?
- I have learned making the overloading, creating a class, and how to set precised.

Quiz 2 Reflection
1. What is the benefit of using dynamic memory allocation?
Wrong answer: We can allocate and deallocate the memory dynamically.
Correct answer: It is more efficient because we can allocate memory only when we need it and deallocate it when we don't need it.
2. What does a C++ reference parameter do?
Wrong answer: type Kingdom *a
Correct answer: It is the parameter that has the address of object.
3. Write down a piece of C++ code that a) allocates memory, b) stores the string "OOP244" and deallocates the memory storage.
Wrong answer: student * Student  = nullptr;
Student = new Student[];
strcpy(*Student, "OOP244");
delete[] student;
Student = nullptr;
Correct answer: char* course = nullptr;
course = new char[6+1];
strcpy(course, "OOP244");
delete[] course;
